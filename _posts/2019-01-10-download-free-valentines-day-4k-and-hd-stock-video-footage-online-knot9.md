We all know content is king, and creating it is an [art](https://www.knot9.com/videos/search/art), but one thing that you don't know is that images and video footage that you pick from different sites to embed in your own, can cost you a huge amount of money and failure in content marketing. The legalities which come with using someone else's clips without permission thereby creating copyright issues, can be a big problem for you anytime, and why not? The professional who has shot the video should get due credits and money for his efforts. Hence, it is always advisable to go for [Indian Stock Footage](https://www.knot9.com/video/people) available at authenticated sites like [www.knot9.com](https://www.knot9.com/) so that you do not face such challenges in future as the business might get affected by taking down the video after it's a big hit.

The common question most of you would be having is how to use this footage directly on your website? Well, here is the answer to how you can use these lifestyle stock videos online directly:

[Go for Royalty Free Videos](https://www.knot9.com/video/people)

Royalty free stock videos are the safest route possible if you want to use someone else's content. It's true that producing your own footage will not only cost you time but a huge amount of money too. Therefore, sometimes it becomes necessary to bank on the third-party content but, with due credits given to it. In the case of royalty free videos, you are permitted to use the videos commercially for your use.

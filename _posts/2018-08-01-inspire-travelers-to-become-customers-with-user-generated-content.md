> Instagram is one of the most popular ways for travelers to discover new destinations. Learn how to harness the power of user-generated content to make your business their next stop.*
> Whether driven by wanderlust, a case of FOMO, or simply the need for a little rest and relaxation, more and more consumers are logging in to Instagram with travel on the brain.*

Would-be travelers are using the social network to search for potential vacation destinations, and as a resource to help them plan their next trip. One study found that 48 percent of users rely on Instagram to help them choose vacation destinations, while 35 percent use it as a destination-discovery tool.

With one billion accounts and 500 million daily users, Instagram has become a souped-up guidebook containing images from virtually every location on Earth. Its travel-specific user-generated content (UGC) knows no end — so it’s no wonder many businesses consider the photo-sharing app a vital addition to their promotional strategies. More than 60 percent of B2C marketing professionals now use Instagram for content-marketing purposes with the intention of promoting their companies and engaging both current and potential customers.

As globetrotters and weekend jetsetters continue to share photos of their adventures, the pool of enticing travel content will only continue to grow. With the right strategy, your business can capitalize on it and inspire travelers to explore your location — and business — for themselves.

How do creatives who make art for a living stay inspired? These ten pro photographers offer their favorite tips for keeping the passion flowing and the work meaningful.
Etymologically, the word “inspiration” suggests some sort of divine guidance, but in reality, inspiration usually doesn’t come to you unbidden. It’s something you have to find yourself. In most cases, sources of inspiration need to be cultivated over long periods of time, and for photographers, learning how and where to get inspiration is as important as learning how to operate a camera.

If you’re feeling stuck, it can be hard to find the motivation to seek new inspiration. For that reason, we asked ten top Shutterstock contributors to tell us about where they find fresh ideas, even when they’re in a creative rut. Some suggested places to visit, while others recommended some helpful exercises to get the juices flowing. Use their tips as a starting point for your own list of inspirational resources!
